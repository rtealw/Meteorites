                            When a continent has smaller countries, one can see how concentrated meteorites 
                            fall in specific locations of a continent. When there are larger countries, 
                            covering more space of the continent, it doesnâ€™t show how concentrated parts 
                            of the continent really are. For example in the United States of America, the 
                            state Alaska is also apart of the collective USA meteorite data even though it 
                            is in a very different location than the other 49 states. Smaller countries 
                            such as the central African countries and the countries surrounding Brazil, 
                            each have about 5 or less meteorites land in their territory. The continent 
                            Antarctica is the darkest color on the map because it has 22,090 documented 
                            meteorite landings, but more interestingly the clusters of each meteorite 
                            landing looks like a larger meteorite erupted into thousands of smaller 
                            pieces and froze in that landed location. At the same time, Antarctica has 
                            more two times the surface area in its territory the the largest country 
                            (Russia), therefore, it would be expected that more meteorites would land 
                            there. It is still interesting to point out that the ocean covers the majority 
                            of our earth and most likely holds the most meteorites due to the lack of 
                            ability to record them. Still the idea of meteorites landing near the south 
                            pole looks like an accurate description of meteorite landing in comparison to 
                            this world choropleth map.")))))
